            <h1>About HyperCube</h1>
            <p>Hypercube is a project that aims to explore the intersection of research and technology.</p>
            <p>The project is inspired by the concept of the hypercube, a four-dimensional geometric shape that represents the idea of multiple dimensions and perspectives. Through this project, we aim to create a platform for collaboration and innovation, bringing together researchers, technologists, and artists to explore new ideas and possibilities.</p>
            <p>We believe that by working together, we can push the boundaries of what is possible and create a better future for all.</p>
